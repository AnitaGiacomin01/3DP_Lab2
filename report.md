## Problems encountered
- We lost significan time due to an unforeseen problem 
with the camera calibration app: for some unknown reason it 
produces an zero-matrix as output parameters on some machines. 
This was solved by launching the program on another system. 
(With otherwise identical parameters and image set)

- The output point clouds have relatively few points and some 
runs of `basic_sfm` produce very sparse or very collapsed point sets. 
It might be necessary to run the program several times to obtain
